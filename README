ABSTRACT:
In this project, our primary objective is to detect early signs of breast cancer by analyzing a breast cancer dataset encompassing various collected characteristics of breast
cancer. We will employ three different machine leaning techniques: the KNN prediction model, logistic regression model, and decision tree model. Each machine learning technique
will be evaluated based on predefined metrics of success in order to determine the most suitable technique for the task.  The four predefined metrics will be sensitivity, 
specificity, accuracy, and precision.


INTRODUCTION:
Breast cancer has always been a growing concern for women in the United States and has continue to impact many woman over the age of 30. Breast cancer is the mutation of 
cells in the breast, causing cells  to grow into large tumors that can travel and cause other tumors in areas such as the arm pit. Even though the survivalability of woman with
breast cancer has increased, an earlier detection of breast cancer would only increase chance of survival.

Cell size and clump thickness are two important features that can provide insights into the nature of breast cancer cells. Generally, larger cell sizes and increased clump 
thickness are associated with malignant or cancerous cells, while smaller cell sizes and lower clump thickness are indicative of benign or non-cancerous cells. 

By analyzing the relationship between cell size and clump thickness in breast cancer data, we can observe patterns and correlations that help in identifying the nature of the 
cells. For example, if we observe a combination of larger cell sizes and higher clump thickness values in a sample, it suggests a higher likelihood of malignant cells. On 
the other hand, smaller cell sizes and lower clump thickness values indicate a higher probability of benign cells.

Machine learning algorithms can leverage these features to learn and classify breast cancer cells into malignant or benign categories. By training a model on a labeled dataset 
that includes cell size and clump thickness information, the model can make predictions on new, unseen data and provide valuable insights into the nature of the breast cancer 
cells under consideration.


DATA:
To ensure replicability and facilitate further research, the dataset that will be used in this project will also be included in the files section of this project. By providing 
access to the dataset, other researchers and practitioners will be able to replicate our experiments, verify our findings, and potentially build upon our work in the field of 
breast cancer detection.

The dataset encompasses 700 records and each record comprising of 11 fields of information. This comprehensive dataset provides significant amount of data to analyze and 
extract insight from, faciliating the exploration and development of models specifically related to breast cancer. 


DEFINITIONS:
KNN prediction model - a classification method used to classify an object by their similarity to its nearest combination of variables. This method is often used when a 
classification of an object can is complex. 

Logistics regression model - a statistical modeling technique using function of weighted independent variables to predict possiblility of dependent variables. We will use 
logistic regression model to predict the nature of cancer cells with the assumption that malignant cancer cells score greater than 0.7.

Decision Tree - supervised model that employs nodes and branches to classify an object. Classification of the object is determined by the result of the leaf nodes, or the
last decision made. 


RESULTS:
After conducting evaluations of the three machine learning techniques, it is important to interpret the distinct meanings conveyed by each evaluation metric. By 
considering these evaluation metrics collectively, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance in terms of correctly identifying both malignant 
and benign class cells. This information is crucial for making informed decisions regarding patient care, resource allocation, and treatment strategies.

Let's take the KNN prediction model as an example to illustrate how we can interpret each metric. By following a similar thought process, we can apply the same analysis 
to the remaining metrics of the other two techniques.

The sensitivity of this model is 0.8889, indicating that it correctly identifies a malignant cell 88.89% of the time for patients with malignant class cells. However, 
it also means that about 12 in 100 patients who have malignant class cells will be incorrectly notified that they have benign class cells. This equates to an error rate of 
12%, which should be taken seriously because it determines whether a patient can react promptly to their results. 

The specificity of this model is 0.9515, indicating that it correctly identifies a benign class cells 95.15% of the time when patients actually have a benign class cells. 
While this number is high and represents a good ability to identify non-life-threatening cases, it is important to acknowledge the relative importance of specificity 
compared to sensitivity.

The accuracy of this model is 0.9325, indicating that it correctly identifies the correct class of cancer 93.25% of the time for all cancer patients. This high accuracy 
implies that out of 100 patients, the model will make only 7 incorrect predictions, assuming an equal distribution of benign and malignant cases.

The precision of this model is 0.8889, indicating that it is correct 88.89% of the time in identifying malignant cancer cells given that the cancer cell is indeed 
malignant. In other words, out of 100 predicted malignant cells, approximately 12 are wrongly predicted.


CONCLUSION
Is there one method that is best than the others, and why?
Yes, there is one method that is best than the others in this case. Since we are dealing with two types of cancers, one where cancer cells are active and one where cancer cells are 
dormant, we must use the method that would help us correctly identify the class if the patient has a malignant cancer cell at the highest rate possible. In this case, the decision tree 
would be the correct model because the sensitivity of the model is the highest. We would reduce our risk that patients allow malignant cancer cells to continue to develop and increase 
the rate of patients reacting to cancer cells with proper treatments.

In the context of cancer detection, sensitivity (the ability to correctly identify malignant class cancer) is typically considered more critical than specificity. It is more crucial 
to accurately notify a cancer patient that their cancer is life-threatening and requires immediate attention and treatment. False negatives (benign cases incorrectly classified as 
malignant) could delay necessary interventions, which can have serious consequences for patients' health outcomes.

While high specificity is desirable to minimize false positives and avoid unnecessary anxiety or treatments for benign cases, striking the right balance between sensitivity and 
specificity is crucial in cancer diagnosis. Efforts should be made to improve sensitivity without compromising specificity, ensuring timely and accurate identification of malignant 
cases while minimizing false negatives.

This precision value is significant because it provides insight into the reliability of the model's predictions when it classifies patients as having a malignant class cancer. A 
higher precision rate implies better allocation of resources to hospitals and patients for the treatment of malignant cancers. It ensures that the resources are appropriately directed 
to individuals who genuinely require them, reducing the likelihood of unnecessary treatments for benign cases.

Improving precision is particularly important in the context of cancer diagnosis to avoid false positive predictions. Enhancing the model's precision can help optimize resource 
allocation and enhance the accuracy of identifying malignant cases, ensuring that patients receive timely and targeted treatment for their specific condition.
